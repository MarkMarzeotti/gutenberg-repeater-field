# Gutenberg Repeater Field

This repo follows a post on my personal portfolio where I discuss the practicality of a ["repeater" field in a Gutenberg/block editor world](https://markmarzeotti.com/snippets/building-a-repeater-field-for-the-gutenberg-block-editor/). While I did not initially see the need for the feature in the traditional sense, I came across a use case for it while building my [Advanced Maps Block](https://github.com/MarkMarzeotti/advanced-maps-block). I broke out the "repeater" portion and documented how it works and how I see it being used in this repo.
